We introduce a novel typing technique for special symbols in the keyboard-only environment. The
technique, called GPK (Gliding on Physical Keyboard), consists of two steps for entering special
symbols. First, a user draws the special symbol on the keyboard by gliding over keys; Second, the user
can select the desired symbol from the predicted symbols generated by GPK. Users can also switch
from this mode to normal typing mode. We also present an application of this input technique based
on web browsers. A user study with nine participants who are familiar with keyboard input showed
the input efficiency of GPK. We compared the typing efficiency of GPK with other special symbol
typing methods. We could deploy this method to office environments where users have desktop
computers with a keyboard only. It could also inspire future work of integrating this method into
word processors, document preparation systems and web environments.
