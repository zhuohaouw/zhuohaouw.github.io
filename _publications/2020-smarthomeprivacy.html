While consumer adoption of smart home devices continues
to grow, privacy concerns reportedly remain a roadblock to
mass adoption. However, it is unclear exactly how the interplay between privacy and other factors affect consumers’
purchase decisions, and whether such considerations are held
only by certain consumer groups but not others. In order to
unpack the decision-making process of smart home device
adoption, we conducted a mixed-method analysis using online survey data collected from 631 US participants. Our
analysis uncovered motivators and blockers of purchase decisions, along with their relative importance. We found that
consumers can be segmented based on their considerations
into three clusters: affordability-oriented, privacy-oriented,
and reliability-oriented. We present an in-depth quantification
of consumer considerations on smart home device adoption
along with desired privacy and security features consumers
wish to use to protect their privacy in the smart home.
