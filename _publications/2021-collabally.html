Collaborative document editing tools are widely used in both professional and academic workplaces. While these tools provide some
accessibility features, it is still challenging for blind users to gain
collaboration awareness that sighted people can easily obtain using
visual cues (e.g., who edited or commented where and what in the
document). To address this gap, we present CollabAlly, a browser
extension that makes extractable collaborative and contextual information in document editing accessible for blind users. With
CollabAlly, blind users can easily access collaborators’ information,
track real-time or asynchronous content and comment changes,
and navigate through these elements. In order to convey this complex information through audio, CollabAlly uses voice fonts and
spatial audio to enhance users’ collaboration awareness in shared
documents. Through a series of pilot studies with a coauthor who is
blind, CollabAlly’s design was refined to include more information
and to be more compatible with existing screen readers
