An interactive 3D printed model (I3M), model that provides
an audio description when a user touches components of
the model, can help people with visual impairments learn
a variety of concepts. However, it is unknown how an I3M
should be designed to serve as an efective teaching aid. To
address this gap, we conducted two studies with Teachers
of the Visually Impaired (TVIs). First, we led two design
workshops with 35 TVIs, who modifed sample models and
added interactive elements to them. Second, we worked with
three TVIs to design three I3Ms in an iterative instructional
design process. At the end of this process, the TVIs used the
I3Ms we designed to teach their students. We conclude that
I3Ms should (1) have efective tactile features (e.g., distinctive
patterns between components), (2) contain both auditory and
visual content (e.g., explanatory animations), and (3) consider
pedagogical methods (e.g., overview before details).
