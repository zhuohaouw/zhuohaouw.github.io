We introduce ChartA11y, an app developed to enable accessible 2-D visualizations on smartphones for blind users through a par- ticipatory and iterative design process involving 13 sessions with two blind partners. We also present a design journey for mak- ing accessible touch experiences that go beyond simple auditory feedback, incorporating multimodal interactions and multisensory data representations. Together, ChartA11y aimed at providing di- rect chart accessing and comprehensive chart understanding by applying a two-mode setting: a semantic navigation framework mode and a direct touch mapping mode. By re-designing traditional touch-to-audio interactions, ChartA11y also extends to accessible scatter plots, addressing the under-explored challenges posed by their non-linear data distribution. Our main contributions encom- pass the detailed participatory design process and the resulting system, ChartA11y, offering a novel approach for blind users to access visualizations on their smartphones.
