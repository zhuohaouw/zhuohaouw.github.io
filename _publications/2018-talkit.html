Tactile models are important learning materials for visually
impaired students. With the adoption of 3D printing
technologies, visually impaired students and teachers will
have more access to 3D printed tactile models. We designed
Talkit++, an iOS application that plays audio and visual
content as a user touches parts of a 3D print. With Talkit++,
a visually impaired student can explore a printed model
tactilely and use hand gestures and speech commands to get
more information about certain elements in the model.
Talkit++ detects the model and hand gestures using
computer vision algorithms, simple accessories like paper
stickers and printable trackers, and the built-in RGB camera
on an iOS device. Based on the model’s position and the
user’s input, Talkit++ speaks textual information, plays
audio recordings, and displays visual animations.
